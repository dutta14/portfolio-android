# HelloWorld

A template Android Hello World project.

## What does this do?
This is the standard 'Hello World' Android project, with a single activity that has the "Hello World" text.

## Why not create a new Android Studio project instead?
When you create a new Android Studio project, you need to usually 'prep up' the project before you can start contributing to it. This repository does the boilerplating for you: adding GitHub workflows for Android, managing checkstyles, getting the minimum number of gradle files onto GitHub, and not having to think about the .gitignore.

## What's not there?
This repository has protected branches which means you cannot push directly to master. This is a good recommendation to have your master always building correctly. However, if you use this as a template, this feature will not trickle down and you will have to set it up by going to your repo's Settings.
